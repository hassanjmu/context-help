# Networking Context-Sensitive Help

This project is a simple, personal context-sensitive help system built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It is designed to provide quick explanations of key Cisco networking concepts, such as OSPF and ACLs, to support my networking studies.

## Features

✅ Easy-to-use interface with buttons for each topic  
✅ Context-sensitive pop-up help using JavaScript  
✅ Responsive design with clean styling  
✅ Simple JSON-like structure for help content  
✅ Ready to expand with more networking concepts as I learn

## Project Structure
/context-help-project/
├── index.html # Main web page
├── style.css # Stylesheet for layout and buttons
└── context-help.js # JavaScript with context-sensitive help data

---

## How it works

- The project uses a small help database stored in a JavaScript object.
- When you click a button (e.g., "What is DR?"), the corresponding help text pops up in an alert box.
- The help system can easily be expanded by adding new topics and keywords to the `helpData` object in `context-help.js`.

## My goals

 ## Future improvements

- Replace pop-up alerts with modern modals or tooltips
- Add a search function to quickly find topics
- Store help data in a separate JSON file
- Style with a CSS framework like Bootstrap or Tailwind
- Add more topics as I advance in networking
